THINGS WE WANT TO DO
=====================

1. command line interface
2. command for zipping a version of the db encrypted with the db public key (or a trusted key)
3. public and private key logins (as well as what we have: user names and passwords)

OPTIMISATIONS/ISSUES
====================
1. usage og bigint in the data ie. {bigint:"0.77blahblahblah"}, so items that are linked to financial transactions dont do any odd rounding
